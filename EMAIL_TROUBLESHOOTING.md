## üîß Step 2: Fix Based on Error

### Error: "Email credentials not configured"

**Fix on Render:**
1. Go to your service ‚Üí **Environment** tab
2. Add these variables:
   - Key: `EMAIL_USER` | Value: `medicdietclinic@gmail.com`
   - Key: `EMAIL_PASS` | Value: `your-16-digit-app-password`
3. Click **Save Changes**
4. Service will automatically redeploy

### Error: "Username and Password not accepted"

**You're using regular Gmail password instead of App Password!**

**Create Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Turn ON "2-Step Verification" (required!)
3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Create new app password:
   - Select: **Mail**
   - Device: **Other** ‚Üí Type: "Medicdiet Server"
5. Copy the **16-character password** (no spaces)
6. Paste in Render as `EMAIL_PASS`

### Error: "Less secure app access blocked"

**Gmail no longer supports this!** Use App Password (see above).

## üìß Step 3: Verify Gmail Settings

### Check your Gmail Account:

1. **2-Step Verification MUST be ON**
   - https://myaccount.google.com/security

2. **Create App Password** (not regular password!)
   - https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

3. **Check Spam/Junk folder**
   - Sometimes first email goes to spam

## üß™ Step 4: Test Email Directly

After setting up credentials on Render, test by visiting:
